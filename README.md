This is a natural selection simulator.

Before you run the simulation you get to choose some setitngs like world size, starting critter count, time for food to spawn, ect and once you do that some critters will spawn in and start eating food.

Critters are simple creaturs. They have 2 main groups of stats. Stats the change thought there lives, like health, energy, and hunger, and stats that don't, there base movment speed, sight distance, color, ect.

Critters eat by making ther mouth touch food and they die when they either get eaten by other critters or starve to death from a lack of food. 

Critters that are able to get enough food can reproduce to make critters that are clones of them with some small changes to there perment stats. This leads to a procces that parralels the real life procces of natural selction just much faster.
